h1. <a name="relation-syntax-many">Using the new syntax @Many<T>@</a>

h3. This is a new syntax to represent:

* the relation from the owner/aggregator entity to the children or aggregated entities in a One2Many/Many2One relation
* the owner side in a multiple owned relation
* the aggregator side in a multiple aggregated relation
* a versatile way to retrieve the children of the relation as a List or as a Query. 

p(note). *Note* with @Many<T>@, you don't have to choose in your model how you want to manipulate your child  entities: you will be able to do it through a simple list retrieved at once or through a query with limits, offsets, filters, ordering etc... 

h3. Siena DO

* _manage the relation_ but not the full life-cycle of related entities.
* _manage relation change_ when you add a child to the One2Many relation. 
* _auto-insert the related entities_ at the same time as the parent (or when updating it) if not done yet.
* _lazy-load the related entities_ only when required.
* _delete-cascade the aggregated entities_ because an aggregated entity can't exist outside its aggregator. *This is the ONLY accepted delete cascade*. 

h3. Siena DOESN'T

* _manage the updates of data within the related entities_. You must save them yourself.
* _delete the owned entities when you delete the owner_ since an owned entity can change owner. Nevertheless, the owned entity is no more associated to any owner.

h2. <a name="relation-syntax-one-owner">@Many<T>@ in an owned relation</a>

p. Here is the owner model:

bc.. public class OwnerModel {
...
	@Owned(mappingBy="owner")
	public One<ChildModel> child;	
...
}

p. Here is the child model:

bc.. public class ChildModel {
...
	public OwnerModel owner;	
...
}

p. *Note* On the child side, the _owner_ field is just written as a simple reference to the owner without any @One<T>@. Why? because, on the owned entity side, the owner is just referenced by its id/key.

p. Using the old notation @Query<T>@, the @One<T>@ is equivalent to:

bc.. public class OwnerModel {
...
	@Filter("owner")
	public Query<ChildModel> child;	
...
}

p. Yet, you should take care of the unicity of the child by yourself.

h2(#relation-syntax-one-aggregate). @One<T>@ in an aggregated relation

p. Here is the aggregator model:

bc.. public class AggregatorModel {
...
	@Aggregated
	public One<ChildModel> child;	
...
}

p. Here is the aggregated model:

bc.. public class AggregatedModel {
...
...
}

p(note). *Note* On the aggregated side, there is no reference to the aggregator because an aggregated entity shall not be aware of its aggregator: it's a part of it but it was not necessarily meant to be. 
It's very useful because you don't need to foresee your model will be aggregated while designing it and you can aggregate any model.
 
bq. The aggregator reference is managed by Siena itself and you don't have to deal with it neither declare it in your model.

p(note). **Note** Nevertheless, if you absolutely want to access your own aggregator, it's possible. Go to the "aggregated relation page":./relation_aggregated.html.

h2(#relation-syntax-one-code). Using One<T> in your code

p. The 3 importants functions of @One<T>@ are: 
* @void set(T obj)@ : a setter to change the OneToXXX related child
* @T get()@ : a getter to get the current child of the OneToXXX relation
* @One<T> forceSync()@ : a useful function to force to resynchronization of the child with the DB when you want to be sure you get the latest version. 

h3(#relation-syntax-one-code-insert). Associate child with @set(T obj)@ & insert child+parent in one call

bc.. Dog pluto = new Dog("Pluto");
		
Person tom = new Person("Tom");
// associates the child entitys
tom.dog.set(pluto);
tom.save(); // or insert(), it's exactly the same behavior
		
p(note). *Note* You don't have to insert the child object as Siena inserts it at the same time as the parent (if the child was not inserted yet).

==<br/>==

h3(#relation-syntax-one-code-get). Retrieve the parent & get the child from parent with @get()@

bc.. Person tom = Person.getByName("Tom");
// here tom's dog is not yet loaded and you can load it through One<T>.get()
Dog pluto = tom.dog.get();
		
p(note). *Note* tom.dog is a @One<Dog>@ so you need to use	@get()@ to access the real object

==<br/>==

h3(#relation-syntax-one-code-get). Change the child with @set(T obj)@ and saves parent+new child

bc.. Person tom = Person.getByName("Tom");
// creates a new dog
Dog medor = new Dog("Medor");
// associates the new dog to the master
tom.dog.set(medor);
// inserts medor, changes the relation and updates tom
tom.update();

// OWNED RELATION ONLY: proves pluto is no more the dog of tom
Dog pluto = Dog.getByName("Pluto");
assert(pluto.master == null);
		

p(note). *Note* In an aggregated relation, when you change the target of the relation and updates the parent, the previous related entity is deleted as it can't exist outside its parent aggregator.

==<br/>==

h3(#relation-syntax-one-code-forcesync). Force synchronization of the child with @forceSync()@

bc.. Person tom = Person.getByName("Tom");
// gets current pluto
Dog pluto = tom.dog.get();
...
// some time later, you want to be sure to have the latest version
Dog pluto = tom.dog.forceSync().get();

p. 

==<br/>==

h3(#relation-syntax-one-code-update-data). Updating data within child is NOT cascaded when updating/saving parent saving

bc.. Person tom = Person.getByName("Tom");
Dog pluto = tom.dog.get();
pluto.name = "Pluto2";

tom.save(); // THIS DOESN'T UPDATE PLUTO
assert(pluto.name.equals("Pluto"));
pluto.save(); // THIS SAVE PLUTO
assert(pluto.name.equals("Pluto2"));
 

h3(#relation-syntax-one-code-update-aggreg).  AGGREGATED RELATION ONLY : Changing the child with @set(T obj)@ deletes previous child

bc..  Car peugeot = Car.getByName("Peugeot");
Motor motor = car.motor.get();
Motor newmotor = new Motor("newmotor");
car.motor.set(newmotor);

peugeot.update();
// motor is also deleted
motor.get(); // throws SienaException()



h3(#relation-syntax-one-code-delete-aggreg). AGGREGATED RELATION ONLY : Delete child is cascaded when deleting aggregator

bc.. Car peugeot = Car.getByName("Peugeot");
Motor motor = car.motor.get();

peugeot.delete();
// motor is also deleted
