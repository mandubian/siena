h1. <a name="title">Reference Relations In Siena</a>

h2. <a name="summary">Summary</a>

<pre><code>A reference relation is:
* a simple directed relation from one originating model towards a targeted model. 
* the originating model doesn't own the relation.
* the originating model doesn't own the targeted model.
* the targeted model has its own lifecycle completely independent from the originating model.

A reference to a model is *physically stored* in the originating model *as a field containing the primary key/id* of the targeted object.
</code></pre>


p. Here is how you write it in a model:

bc.. public class YourModel extends Model {
...
	// This annotation is not mandatory at all and is just to precise the relation
	// by default a relation is referenced in Siena
	@Referenced
	public YourReferencedModel ref;	
...
}

p(note). *IMPORTANT TO KNOW*: Siena is aimed at bridging SQL/NoSQL. *Almost all NoSQL DB have a limitation compared to SQL DB which is the absence of JOIN request*. In NoSQL, when you fetch the originating model, you can't fetch the targeted model in the same query (which is possible in a SQL DB with a left join). 
So, as Siena tries to provide the minimum intersection between SQL/NoSQL, by default, it doesn't manage JOIN requests (there are ways to do it in Siena anyway, please see the join doc for this). *The only field of the targeting object to be retrieved with the originating object is the ID of the targeted object*. 
Then, if you want to fetch the full targeted object, you must do it yourself with a second request to the datastore.

Here is an illustration of this: 

bc.. // First request to get the originating object 
YourModel obj = Model.getByKey(YourModel.class, id);
assert(obj.rel != null);
assert(obj.rel.id != null);
assert(obj.rel.anyField == null);

// Second request to get the full targeted object
obj.ref.get();
assert(obj.rel != null);
assert(obj.rel.id != null);
assert(obj.rel.anyField != null);


p. Now let's present the different types of referenced relations with samples: 

==<br/>==

h2. <a name="unowned-one-to-one-1-way">Unowned One-to-One 1-Way</a>

p. Take this Example:
A person has a cat but the cat doesn't belong to this person because a cat has no master. So the person knows her cat but the cat doesn't need to know the person.
So we create 2 models.

p. Here is the simple Cat model:

bc.. @Table("sample_unowned_onetoone_cat") 
public class Cat extends Model{

	@Id(Generator.AUTO_INCREMENT)
	public Long id;
	
	@Column("name") @Max(100)
	public String name;

	public static Query<Cat> all() {
		return Model.all(Cat.class);
	}
	
	public static Batch<Cat> batch() {
		return Model.batch(Cat.class);
	}
	
	public Cat() {
	}

	public Cat(String name) {
		this.name = name;
	}

	public String toString() {
		return "id: "+id+", name: "+name;
	}
}


p. Here is the Person with a reference to the cat represented by a Cat object.

bc.. @Table("sample_unowned_onetoone_person")
public class Person extends Model{

	@Id(Generator.AUTO_INCREMENT)
	public Long id;
	
	public String name;
	
	// The relation to the cat
	// REMIND THAT THIS ANNOTATION CAN BE SKIPPED
	@Referenced		
	public Cat cat;
	
	public static Query<Person> all() {
		return Model.all(Person.class);
	}
	
	public static Batch<Person> batch() {
		return Model.batch(Person.class);
	}
	
	public static Person getByName(String name){
		return all().filter("name", name).get();
	}
	
	public Person() {
	}

	public Person(String name) {
		this.name = name;
	}

	public String toString() {
		return "id: "+id+", name: "+name;
	}

}

p. Now, here is the code to manipulate this model:

bc.. // First create a cat 
Cat mistigri = new Cat("Mistigri");
mistigri.save();
		
// Now the person who recognizes mistigri as her cat
Person bob = new Person("Bob");
bob.cat = mistigri;
bob.save();
		
// Now retrieves the person from the datastore again
Person bobbis = Person.getByName("Bob");

// The cat object is not null in the person.
// But Siena doesn't fetch the whole cat object but only the ID of the cat.
assertEquals(bob.id, bobbis.id);
assertNull(bobbis.cat.name);

// to get to whole cat object, you must explictly request it
bobbis.cat.get();

assertEquals(bob.id, bobbis.id);
assertEquals(bob.name, bobbis.name);
assertEquals(mistigri.id, bobbis.cat.id);
assertEquals(mistigri.name, bobbis.cat.name);

p. *Note* When you request a Person, its _cat_ field is partially filled: basically, only the __cat.id__ field is contained in the _Person_ table and retrieved at the same time as the person.

==<br/>==

h2(#unowned-one-to-one-1-way). <a name="unowned-one-to-one-2-ways">Unowned One-to-One 2-ways</a>

p. Take this stupid example:
Imagine a planetary system where a planet has a single satellite (Earth+Moon for ex) and the satellite turns around its planet but the satellite doesn't completely belong to the planet and could change planet if a stronger gravitational object went around there.
So we create 2 models.

p. First the Planet class with a reference to a Satellite:

bc.. @Table("sample_unowned_one2one2ways_planet")
public class Planet extends Model{

	@Id(Generator.AUTO_INCREMENT)
	public Long id;
	
	public String name;
	
	// The relation to the cat
	// REMIND THAT THIS ANNOTATION CAN BE SKIPPED
	@Referenced
	public Satellite sat;
	
	public static Query<Planet> all() {
		return Model.all(Planet.class);
	}
	
	public static Batch<Planet> batch() {
		return Model.batch(Planet.class);
	}
	
	public static Planet getByName(String name){
		return all().filter("name", name).get();
	}
	
	public Planet() {
	}

	public Planet(String name) {
		this.name = name;
	}

	public String toString() {
		return "id: "+id+", name: "+name+"satellite:"+sat;
	}

}

p. Now the Satellite class with a reference to a planet:

bc.. @Table("sample_unowned_one2one2ways_satellite")
public class Satellite extends Model{

	@Id(Generator.AUTO_INCREMENT)
	public Long id;
	
	public String name;
	
	@Referenced
	public Planet planet;

	public static Query<Satellite> all() {
		return Model.all(Satellite.class);
	}
	
	public static Batch<Satellite> batch() {
		return Model.batch(Satellite.class);
	}
	
	public Satellite() {
	}

	public Satellite(String name) {
		this.name = name;
	}
	
	public static Satellite getByName(String name){
		return all().filter("name", name).get();
	}

	public String toString() {
		return "id: "+id+" - name: "+name+" - planet:"+planet;
	}
}

p. Now the code to manage those models.

bc.. // First create the satellite without referencing the planet
Satellite moon = new Satellite("Moon");
moon.save();
// Second create the planet and link it to the satellite
Planet earth = new Planet("Earth");
earth.sat = moon;
earth.save();
// Finally link the satellite to the planet
moon.planet = earth;
moon.update();

Planet earthbis = Planet.getByName("Earth");
// To fully fill the sat field, get it explicitly
earthbis.sat.get();
assertEquals(earth.id, earthbis.id);
assertEquals(earth.name, earthbis.name);
assertEquals(moon.id, earthbis.sat.id);
assertEquals(moon.name, earthbis.sat.name);

Satellite moonbis = Satellite.getByName("Moon");
// To fully fill the planet field, get it explicitly
moonbis.planet.get();
assertEquals(moon.id, moonbis.id);
assertEquals(moon.name, moonbis.name);
assertEquals(earth.id, moonbis.planet.id);
assertEquals(earth.name, moonbis.planet.name);

p(note). In a 2-ways relation, you can't save both objects (or entities) at the same time because, to be referenced, an object must be inserted (and assigned an ID).

==<br/>==

h2. <a name="unowned-many-to-one-1-way">Unowned Many-to-One</a>

bq.. This relation is just the same as a One-to-One 1-way relation where you have several objects (the Many side) linked to the same object (the One side). 
So if you need an example, look at paragraph "Unowned One-to-One 1-way":#unowned-one-to-one-1-way
